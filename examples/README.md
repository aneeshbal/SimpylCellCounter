# Examples
##### - `images` folder contains sample images for example notebooks
##### - navigate to `1x` to run SCC 1.0...this version works best on brightfield images with circular cells
##### - navigate to `2x` to run SCC 2.0 "beta" version...this version works well with fluorescent images (and brightfield) and cells of irregular shape.... IMPORTANT: SCC 2.0 is still "under construction", so it will be updated frequently, likely leading to different results
